** mechanisms
mechanism is both process and product
seems to be suggesting a close reading of technologies and artifacts

** literature, media, information systems (kitler)
in the age of computers, all information/media is interchangable; video, text, etc are just shallow choices on how to display

kitler uses example of airplane, in which the reality (inhospitable environment, complex flight systems) is hidden from users by friendly distractions
- kind of two worlds
- in america, there is no hacking/modding/repairing culture, so the difference is even more pronounced

notions of what an author is and how they are read are always histoically determined, aspects of a larger communications system
- literature can be treated as a form of data processing
- texts cannot be read independant of literary discouse; in order to make "sense" of literature, we need literary culture
- before rise of gramaphone, film, typewritier, literature had a monopoly on discouse networks. after, the materiality of literature could not be ignored. before, language had romantic/spiritual powers, but typewritier removes writing from sensuous hands. surrealism deals with mechanically writing down sense impressions, which makes sense for this moment**** Kitler, Friedrich., /Literature, Media, Information Systems/ (1997)
